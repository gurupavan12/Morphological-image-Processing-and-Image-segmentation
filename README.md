# Morphological-image-Processing-and-Image-segmentation
Tasks completed - Morphological Image processing, edge detection, erosion, dilation, image filtering

Here, an image shown below namely Noisy image, is taken and morphological image processing technqiues are used without the use of inbuilt MATLAB functions to get rid of the noisy lines. Furthermore, all the characters that are not tall are removed i.e. only D, P, I and l are kept in the figure. The tasks that were to be done are included in the file p5.pdf. This project required us to submit the files in MATLAB by performing Image processing methods without the use of inbuilt MATLAB function for DIP. Please find the report Project5Report_PavanGurudath.pdf that contains the entire report for this project.
